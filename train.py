"""
This module provides functions related to the management
of the position of the train.

A train_position variable is a list consisting of a number and a deque.
The deque contains railway graph vertex indices. The first vertex from
the right is the one that the train is currently heading to, and the
previous ones represent the previously visited vertices. The number in
the train_position list is the current offset of the front of the train
from the vertex deque[-2] to deque[-1].
